# My Chart ! (using React.js)

### Getting Started

This app will allow you to make your own chart with Reactjs and Chart.js. Test it !
For running the app, make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) npm version 3+ and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Use those commands to generate node_modules & co (using create react app).
```
npx create-react-app name-of-your-app
cd name-of-your-app
npm start
```

For mychart.js 2:
```
$ npm install react-chartjs-2 chart.js --save

When your files and folders are created, you can replace what is inside and src/ by what is on this github.
